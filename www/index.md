`criterion` is a library that makes accurate microbenchmarking in
Haskell easy.


# Features

* The simple API hides a lot of automation and details that you
  shouldn't need to worry about.

* Sophisticated, high-resolution analysis can measure operations
  that run in as little as a few hundred picoseconds.

* Output to active HTML (with Javascript charts), CSV, and JSON.
  Write your own report templates to customize exactly how your
  results are presented.

* Measurements are cross-validated to ensure that sources of
  significant noise (usually other activity on the system) can be
  identified.

I've worked hard to make `criterion` easy to learn, so that you can
write dependable, accurate benchmarks without having to become a
benchmarking expert.
